This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my studies at the University of Applied Sciences in Bjelovar.

Please note:

The .NET project(s) associated with these endeavors are not included due to their large file size.
Final papers are also excluded to respect intellectual property restrictions.
However, if access to a specific .NET project or final paper is necessary, you can contact me via email at butuzin.borna@gmail.com to arrange a secure delivery or a Zoom call for viewing purposes.

This repository serves as a showcase of my academic work and provides access to the source code for various projects. Feel free to explore the contents and reach out if you have any questions.
